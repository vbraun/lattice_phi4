Lattice Simulation of Phi^4 Theory
==================================

This code computes a numerical approximation to the quantum field
theory of a 2-d massive scalar field with phi^4 interaction.


Steps to Run
------------

The analysis makes use of Sage (http://www.sagemath.org), I'm assuming
that you have it installed and it can be called with "sage" on the
command line.w

1. Download this code.

2. Compile inside the Sage shell:

    sage -sh -c make

3. Start Sage and `import phi4`. Or, for a more elaborate example:

    sage: load('phase_plot.py')
